Fo sho:
  - remember reading position / applied effects (per comic)
  - offline mode via cache manifest
  - firefox marketplace
  - create onclose callback, show close button only if set
  - trigger preload if requesting valid but not loaded images (can happen if network was interupted)
  - loading and generally hackiness of pointer is buggy, fix.
  - check for html5 feature support where used: diveintohtml5.org/everything.html or www.modernizr.com

Nice 2 have:
  - remove image inhancement lag when navigating by pre-applying enhancements to other pages
  - jump to page?
  - make page draggable with the cursor
  - enable menu items via config, allow for custom items
  - split out classes into seperate files
  - thumbnail browser
  - refactor so we are not using all these loose shared variables and other nastyness
  - use custom event emitters instead of hacky code
  - properly bind 'this' so we don't have to keep using 'self'
  - allow toolbar to be hidden on mobile (maybe show a small translucent button that opens the toolbar when clicked)
  - enhancement progress bar
